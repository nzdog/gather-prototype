# Inbox

This folder is for new documentation drops that haven't been categorized yet.

## Process

1. **Drop new docs here** initially
2. **Review weekly** (or when > 5 files accumulate)
3. **Move to appropriate folders** based on content type
4. **Don't let this accumulate** more than 5 files

## Where Should It Go?

Ask yourself:

- **What we're building?** → `01_product/`
- **How it should look/feel?** → `02_ux/`
- **How to build it?** → `03_specs/`
- **When/what's next?** → `04_roadmap/`
- **How to run/test?** → `05_ops/`
- **Meeting notes?** → `07_meetings/`
- **Images/diagrams?** → `assets/`
- **Old/deprecated?** → `_archive/`

When in doubt, ask the team or leave it here with a note.
