# Deep Research Brief: UI Design Examples for Gather

## Research Objective

Find examples of web and mobile interfaces that embody the design principles established for the Gather coordination system. We're looking for interfaces that disappear into their function — tools that users forget they're using because the task itself is so clear.

This is **not** a search for "beautiful UI" or "award-winning design." We're looking for interfaces that are:
- Radically simple
- Task-focused to the point of invisibility
- Calm rather than engaging
- Designed to be used once and forgotten

---

## Core Principles to Match

### 1. Recognition Over Orientation

We want interfaces where users **instantly recognize** what they need to do, rather than interfaces that help users "find their way around."

**Look for:**
- Single-purpose screens
- Immediate clarity on arrival
- No onboarding, no tours, no explanation needed
- The primary information is unmissable

**Avoid:**
- Dashboards
- Navigation-heavy interfaces
- Apps that require learning

---

### 2. Calm Over Engaging

We want interfaces that feel **settled and quiet**, not interfaces designed to maximize engagement or time-on-site.

**Look for:**
- Minimal color usage
- No notifications, badges, or alerts
- No gamification
- No social proof ("5 people are viewing this")
- No urgency signals ("Only 2 left!")

**Avoid:**
- Engagement-optimized SaaS dashboards
- Social media patterns
- E-commerce conversion tactics

---

### 3. Sufficiency Without Excess

We want interfaces that show **exactly what's needed** — nothing missing, nothing extra.

**Look for:**
- Every element answers an obvious question
- No decorative UI
- Whitespace as structure, not decoration
- Information density that feels inevitable, not designed

**Avoid:**
- Sparse "minimal" interfaces that hide information
- Cluttered interfaces with everything visible
- Feature-rich dashboards

---

### 4. Task Completion Over Feature Discovery

We want interfaces designed for **completing a task and leaving**, not for exploration or engagement.

**Look for:**
- Clear single action per screen
- Linear flows with obvious endpoints
- "Done" states that feel finished
- No reason to return unless necessary

**Avoid:**
- Feature-rich apps that reward exploration
- Interfaces with "discover" or "explore" sections
- Apps designed for repeated daily use through habit

---

### 5. Mobile-Native Simplicity

We want interfaces that work **one-handed, distracted, interruptible** — designed for real mobile use, not adapted from desktop.

**Look for:**
- Large tap targets
- Thumb-reachable primary actions
- Glanceable information
- Graceful interruption handling

**Avoid:**
- Desktop-first designs adapted to mobile
- Complex navigation on mobile
- Small tap targets or precise interactions

---

## Specific Categories to Research

### Category A: One-Time Task Completion Interfaces

Interfaces for tasks you do once and are done:
- Voting / polling interfaces
- RSVP systems
- Simple booking confirmations
- Receipt or ticket displays
- Delivery tracking (final state, not progress)

**Example qualities:** You arrive, you see your information, you may tap once, you leave. No account. No return visit expected.

---

### Category B: Quiet Coordination Tools

Interfaces for group coordination that avoid surveillance and comparison:
- Signup sheets (SignUpGenius, but better)
- Potluck organizers
- Simple scheduling tools (not Calendly's full UX)
- Event RSVPs with role assignment

**Example qualities:** You see what you're responsible for. You don't see what others are doing. You don't see if others have responded.

---

### Category C: Status-at-a-Glance Displays

Interfaces that show system health without surveillance:
- Simple status pages (e.g., GitHub Status, but calmer)
- Flight/transit status displays
- Weather displays (information, not engagement)
- Monitoring dashboards that show state, not activity

**Example qualities:** Red/yellow/green at a glance. No graphs. No history. Current state only.

---

### Category D: Read-and-Confirm Interfaces

Interfaces where the entire interaction is: read something, confirm receipt:
- Legal document acceptance flows
- Terms of service with clear accept
- Consent flows
- Simple approval interfaces

**Example qualities:** Information is presented. One action available. Done.

---

### Category E: Magic Link / Token-Based Access

Interfaces accessed via unique link rather than login:
- Email unsubscribe pages
- Review request flows
- Simple survey responses
- Shared document views (view-only)

**Example qualities:** No account needed. Link = access. Single purpose.

---

## Design Movements / Philosophies to Investigate

### Calm Technology

Research interfaces influenced by "calm technology" principles (Mark Weiser, Amber Case). Look for examples that:
- Inform without demanding attention
- Use the periphery effectively
- Respect human attention as finite

### Anti-Dashboard Design

Find critiques of dashboard culture and examples of alternatives:
- "The Dashboard Trap" or similar essays
- Designers who explicitly reject metric-heavy displays
- Alternatives to the "everything at a glance" pattern

### Brutalist Web Design (Functional Variant)

Not the aesthetic movement, but the **function-first** variant:
- Craigslist's durability (function over form)
- Government service designs (GOV.UK patterns)
- Interfaces that prioritize clarity over beauty

### Japanese Interface Design

Look for examples of Japanese web/app design that embody:
- Extreme clarity of purpose
- Information density without clutter
- Functional minimalism (not aesthetic minimalism)

## Specific Products / Companies to Investigate

Research the design philosophy and specific screens from:

### Likely Good Examples

| Product | Why Investigate |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Linear** | Known for calm, keyboard-driven design |
| **Notion** | Controversial — find the simple embedded views |
| **Buttondown** | Newsletter tool known for restraint |
| **Plausible Analytics** | Anti-surveillance positioning |
| **Hey Email** | Deliberately anti-notification |
| **GOV.UK** | Government services designed for everyone |
| **Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)** | Transit displays, status clarity |
| **Stripe Checkout** | One-screen payment focus |
| **Carrd** | Single-page site builder, extreme simplicity |

### Products to Investigate for Contrast

| Product | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------|
| **Superhuman** | Where does "productivity design" go wrong? |
| **Notion** | Where does it feel like too much? |
| **Calendly** | What scheduling flows are too complex? |
| **Monday.com** | What makes dashboards feel heavy? |
| **Asana** | Where does project management get surveillance-y? |

## Questions to Answer

For each example found, answer:

1. **First Glance Test:** Can you understand the purpose within 3 seconds?

2. **Task Clarity:** Is there exactly one thing to do, or are there competing options?

3. **Social Visibility:** Can you see other users' activity or state? Should you?

4. **Effort Proportionality:** Is the interaction effort matched to the task importance?

5. **Return Necessity:** Would you need to come back? Is that intentional?

6. **Memory Residue:** Would you remember using this interface tomorrow?

---

## Output Requested

For each relevant example found:

### Basic Information
- Product/interface name
- URL or screenshot source
- Primary use case

### Design Analysis
- How does it achieve clarity?
- What does it explicitly NOT show?
- How does it handle task completion?

### Relevance to Gather
- Which Gather law does it exemplify?
- What specific screen/pattern is applicable?
- What would we adapt vs. adopt directly?

### Limitations
- Where does it fall short of our principles?
- What would we do differently?

---

## Secondary Research: Essays and Thinking

Also find written pieces about:

### Design Philosophy
- Essays on "calm design" or "anti-engagement design"
- Critiques of attention-harvesting UX
- Writing about "tools vs. products"

### Specific Critiques
- Why dashboards fail
- Problems with activity feeds
- The cost of notifications

### Case Studies
- Redesigns that removed features and improved outcomes
- Products that deliberately avoided growth-hacking UX
- Government digital services design documentation

---

## What NOT to Find

Please exclude:

- **Award-winning UI** that prioritizes aesthetics over function
- **Dribbble/Behance concepts** that were never built
- **Startup landing pages** (marketing, not product)
- **Admin panels** designed for power users
- **Dashboards** (we're explicitly anti-dashboard)
- **Social apps** (inherently engagement-optimized)
- **E-commerce** (inherently conversion-optimized)

---

## Success Criteria

The research is successful if it delivers:

1. **5-10 strong examples** of interfaces that embody our principles
2. **3-5 specific patterns** we can directly reference in Figma
3. **2-3 essays/resources** that articulate the philosophy we're applying
4. **Clear contrast examples** showing what we're avoiding

The goal is not comprehensive coverage. It's finding the few examples that genuinely match, so we can point to them and say: "like this."
