Protocol: Turning the Christmas Coordination Spreadsheet into a SaaS

Purpose

To deliver architectural clarity on every component required to turn the team-based Christmas planning workbook into a SaaS/web app—so the build can be scoped, sequenced, and executed without hidden complexity.

Why This Matters

Spreadsheet-based coordination fails at scale because it concentrates cognitive load, permissions risk, and social ambiguity in a single brittle artifact. A SaaS succeeds only if it converts the same coordination logic into a resilient system: clear roles, a stable data model, explicit workflows, and low-friction participation—while remaining simple enough that families will actually use it year after year.

Use This When
	•	There is a working spreadsheet system (like the team-based workbook) and the goal is to productize it.
	•	A build is being considered and clarity is needed before hiring, budgeting, or writing specs.
	•	Feature ambition is rising and must be constrained to a walkable MVP.
	•	Multiple events/days, teams, and constraints must be coordinated repeatedly.

Outcomes

Poor

A “spreadsheet-but-online” app gets built: unclear roles, messy data, no workflow states, and participation remains optional and confusing—leading to low adoption now and a future where the product cannot scale without a rewrite.

Expected

A clear component map exists (roles, objects, workflows, views, permissions, notifications), enabling an MVP spec that can be built and shipped; the future path stays open because the data model and states are coherent from day one.

Excellent

An MVP scope is locked that preserves the magic (modular teams + coordinator layer) while removing friction (mobile-first, minimal edits, clear ownership); the future roadmap is explicit, sequenced, and costed enough to guide investment and execution.

Transcendent

The system becomes a reusable coordination substrate for any multi-day, multi-team gathering (not just Christmas), with a future where templates, repeat events, and lightweight automation make coordination feel calm, social, and inevitable.

Themes

Theme 1: Define the Product Boundary

Purpose
To decide what the SaaS is—and what it refuses to be.

Why This Matters
Most coordination apps die by feature sprawl. The boundary is the product.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The app tries to cover meals, shopping, seating plans, budgeting, recipes, and messaging—creating a future of complexity and abandonment.
	•	Expected: The product is defined as “team-based responsibility coordination for gatherings,” creating a future where the feature set stays small and coherent.
	•	Excellent: The product boundary is expressed as a one-sentence Job-to-be-Done plus explicit non-goals, creating a future where every feature request is easy to accept or reject.
	•	Transcendent: The boundary becomes a template engine for social coordination (gatherings, retreats, reunions), creating a future where the same architecture expands across contexts without losing simplicity.

Guiding Questions
	•	What is the single job the app must do better than spreadsheets?
	•	What are three hard non-goals that will never be built?
	•	What is the smallest “successful event” definition?

⸻

Theme 2: Users, Roles, and Permission Model

Purpose
To define exactly who can do what, and why.

Why This Matters
Adoption depends on reducing participation friction while protecting coordination integrity.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Everyone can edit everything; the future is chaos, blame, and permission anxiety.
	•	Expected: Roles exist (Host, Coordinator, Participant) with clear permissions, creating a future where people feel safe and the plan stays stable.
	•	Excellent: “Most people never edit” is enforced by design (view-only participation, coordinator-only edits), creating a future where engagement increases because effort drops.
	•	Transcendent: Permissions become a reusable governance pattern (lightweight, social, resilient), creating a future where coordination works even with partial engagement.

Guiding Questions
	•	What permissions does a Host need that a Coordinator must not have (and vice versa)?
	•	What is the default permission for a normal participant?
	•	What actions must be impossible once the plan is “frozen”?

⸻

Theme 3: Core Data Model

Purpose
To identify the minimum set of objects/tables the system must represent.

Why This Matters
If the data model is wrong, every feature becomes expensive and the future becomes rewrite territory.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Data is stored as blobs (notes, free-text lists); the future is brittle filtering and manual cleanup.
	•	Expected: Core objects are defined (Event, Day, Team, Person, Assignment, Item, Constraint, Status), creating a future where the app can grow without structural breakage.
	•	Excellent: Relationships are explicit (one-person-one-team membership, many assignments per team, items tied to days), creating a future where automation and reporting become easy.
	•	Transcendent: The data model supports templates and repeatability, creating a future where “next year” is a one-click clone with controlled edits.

Guiding Questions
	•	What are the “nouns” the app cannot function without?
	•	Which objects must exist before anything else can be created?
	•	What does “one person only in one team” mean in database terms?

⸻

Theme 4: Workflow States and System Rules

Purpose
To turn social coordination into explicit states that guide behavior.

Why This Matters
Spreadsheets rely on human vigilance; software must carry the coordination logic.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: No states exist; the future is constant renegotiation and last-minute churn.
	•	Expected: Basic states exist (Draft → Confirming → Frozen → Live → Completed), creating a future where planning stabilizes over time.
	•	Excellent: Rule gates exist (e.g., cannot freeze with unassigned critical items; cannot add new items after freeze without override), creating a future where the system prevents predictable failure.
	•	Transcendent: Workflow becomes a calm ritual that families repeat annually, creating a future where coordination feels like an easy tradition instead of a negotiation.

Guiding Questions
	•	What does “Frozen plan” technically prevent?
	•	What must be true before a day/event can be marked “Ready”?
	•	What are the minimum failure-tolerance rules (redundancy, over-assignment, critical items)?

Theme 5: Views and UX Surfaces

Purpose
To define the screens/pages that make the system usable for real humans.

Why This Matters
A correct backend with a confusing UI still fails; the future depends on effortless participation.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The UI mirrors spreadsheets; the future is drop-off and coordinator fatigue.
	•	Expected: Three primary views exist (Overview, Team Sheet, Personal Commitments), creating a future where each user sees only what matters.
	•	Excellent: Mobile-first flows reduce friction (one-tap “I’m in,” coordinator assignment tools, clear status), creating a future where participation becomes lightweight and habitual.
	•	Transcendent: The UI becomes “socially invisible” (it disappears into the process), creating a future where coordination feels natural rather than technical.

Guiding Questions
	•	What is the one screen a Coordinator lives in?
	•	What is the one screen a Participant needs?
	•	What must the Overview show—and what must it forbid?

⸻

Theme 6: Communication and Notifications

Purpose
To decide how the system nudges action without becoming spam.

Why This Matters
Coordination depends on timely prompts; the future depends on trust and non-annoyance.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Notifications are noisy or absent; the future is missed commitments or people muting the app.
	•	Expected: Essential notifications exist (assignment, reminder, freeze notice), creating a future where the plan progresses predictably.
	•	Excellent: Coordinators can send targeted team nudges and broadcast only when needed, creating a future where communication load collapses without losing clarity.
	•	Transcendent: Communication becomes “consent-based orchestration,” creating a future where families trust the system because it respects attention.

Guiding Questions
	•	What are the only three notifications that must exist in MVP?
	•	Who can message whom inside the system?
	•	What is the fallback if people never enable notifications?

⸻

Theme 7: SaaS Foundations

Purpose
To identify the platform components that make this a real product, not a prototype.

Why This Matters
Payments, security, reliability, and support define whether the future is viable.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: No clear plan for auth, privacy, backups, and billing; the future is fragile and non-commercial.
	•	Expected: MVP foundations exist (login, org/group, basic privacy, backups), creating a future where real users can trust the product.
	•	Excellent: Pricing, onboarding, and support are aligned with the target buyer (host/coordinator), creating a future where the business can grow without heroic effort.
	•	Transcendent: The foundation supports templating, repeat events, and multi-context use, creating a future where the product becomes the default way groups coordinate gatherings.

Guiding Questions
	•	Who pays: host, coordinator, or family group?
	•	What personal data is stored, and what is the minimum needed?
	•	What is the simplest onboarding that works for non-technical users?

⸻

Completion Prompts
	•	A single-page “Component Map” exists listing: Roles/Permissions, Core Objects, Workflow States, Primary Screens, Notification Rules, and SaaS Foundations.
	•	An MVP scope is locked with: must-have features, explicit non-goals, and a sequenced roadmap (MVP → v1 → v2).
	•	A build plan exists that could be handed to a developer without interpretation gaps.
	•	The future is protected: the data model and workflow states are designed so growth does not require rewriting the core.
