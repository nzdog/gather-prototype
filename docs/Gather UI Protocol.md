Protocol: Designing the UI for the Christmas Coordination System

⸻

Purpose

To design a user interface that delivers clarity, sufficiency, and calm—so every person involved knows exactly what they are responsible for, has all the information they need, and is never exposed to coordination complexity that is not theirs to carry.

⸻

Why This Matters

Coordination systems fail not because people refuse to participate, but because interfaces either overwhelm them with too much information or underserve them with too little. A UI that hides complexity without answering questions creates anxiety; a UI that shows everything creates cognitive overload and social friction.

This protocol ensures the interface does the system’s real job:
holding responsibility clearly, answering all practical questions, and allowing people to put the task down with confidence—without requiring vigilance, follow-up, or explanation.

When the UI succeeds, trust becomes structural rather than social, coordination becomes repeatable rather than heroic, and future gatherings require less energy each time instead of more.

⸻

Use This When
	•	A backend, data model, and workflow logic already exist and the primary risk is human usability.
	•	Multiple roles (Host, Coordinator, Participant) must coexist without leaking responsibility.
	•	Participation must be low-friction, low-touch, and viable on mobile by default.
	•	The system must feel complete and reliable without feeling administrative or technical.
	•	A Figma or design-system specification is about to be generated and needs governing constraints.

⸻

Outcomes

Poor

The UI mirrors spreadsheets or admin dashboards, exposing too much information or too little context—creating a future where users feel overwhelmed, judged, unsure of their responsibilities, and dependent on follow-up communication to compensate for ambiguity.

Expected

Clear, role-based views exist that surface exactly what each user needs—creating a future where most participants can understand their role, confirm their commitment, and disengage confidently in under a minute.

Excellent

The UI enforces containment by default: participants never see coordination complexity, coordinators never see other teams’ internals, and hosts see system health rather than individual behavior—creating a future where trust is embedded in structure rather than maintained socially.

Transcendent

The interface becomes socially invisible: people experience it as a calm handoff of responsibility rather than “using an app”—creating a future where coordination feels natural, repeatable, and non-technical across years and contexts.

⸻

Themes

⸻

Theme 1: Emotional Contract of the Interface

Purpose
To define the emotional outcome the UI must reliably produce—clarity, sufficiency, and settledness—before any layout, components, or visual language are designed.

Why This Matters
People do not experience coordination stress because tasks exist, but because responsibility feels ambiguous or incomplete. Without an explicit emotional contract, design decisions default to aesthetics or convention, producing interfaces that look simple but feel unresolved.

This theme anchors every UI decision to a felt result: “I know what I’m responsible for, I have everything I need, and nothing else requires my attention.”

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The UI optimizes for visual cleanliness rather than emotional resolution, creating a future where users still feel unsure despite “simple” screens.
	•	Expected: The UI consistently produces clarity and calm, creating a future where users trust the interface to tell them what matters.
	•	Excellent: The emotional contract is testable and enforced, creating a future where design debates resolve quickly because the feeling is the arbiter.
	•	Transcendent: The emotional contract generalizes beyond Christmas, creating a future where the same UI principles support any gathering or shared responsibility system.

⸻

Theme 2: Question Elimination as the Core Design Test

Purpose
To ensure every screen answers all the questions it introduces, while excluding any element that does not directly resolve uncertainty.

Why This Matters
A UI that raises questions—even subtle ones—exports cognitive work back to humans. Labels without context (“assigned,” “ready,” “confirmed”) may be brief, but they create follow-up conversations, second-guessing, and coordination drag.

This theme makes question elimination the primary design test: if a screen causes a user to ask something, the interface has failed.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Screens introduce ambiguity, creating a future of messages, reminders, and clarifications.
	•	Expected: Each screen resolves the practical questions it raises, creating a future where follow-up communication drops.
	•	Excellent: Question–answer integrity becomes a design reflex, creating a future where new features do not reintroduce uncertainty.
	•	Transcendent: The system feels self-explanatory across cultures and ages, creating a future where onboarding is unnecessary.

⸻

Theme 3: Role-Bounded Visibility

Purpose
To strictly contain what each role can see and act on, so no user is exposed to information or decisions that are not theirs to carry.

Why This Matters
Most coordination anxiety comes from seeing problems one cannot fix. Visibility without agency produces guilt, pressure, and social tension.

This theme ensures responsibility is architecturally contained, preventing users from inheriting emotional or cognitive load through mere exposure.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Users see gaps and decisions they cannot influence, creating a future of stress and overreach.
	•	Expected: Each role sees only what they own, creating a future where responsibility feels clear and bounded.
	•	Excellent: Containment holds even under stress, creating a future where the system remains calm during disruptions.
	•	Transcendent: Role-bounded visibility becomes a governance pattern reusable in other systems.

⸻

Theme 4: Sufficiency Without Excess

Purpose
To balance completeness and simplicity—showing everything required for confidence and nothing that introduces distraction, comparison, or anxiety.

Why This Matters
Minimalism alone is insufficient. Hiding necessary information creates uncertainty; showing surplus information creates overwhelm. The design challenge is not reduction, but precision.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The UI oscillates between sparse and cluttered, creating a future of redesign cycles.
	•	Expected: Screens provide complete information for action, creating a future where users feel settled.
	•	Excellent: Sufficiency becomes measurable, creating a future where additions are deliberate.
	•	Transcendent: The system teaches teams how to design calm interfaces elsewhere.

⸻

Theme 5: Primary Views and Surfaces

Purpose
To define the minimal set of screens each role needs and ensure each view serves one clear responsibility.

Why This Matters
When interfaces lack a clear “home,” users wander, over-inspect, or disengage. Too many views fragment attention; too few overload responsibility.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Users navigate unnecessarily, creating a future of fatigue.
	•	Expected: Each role has one primary surface, creating a future of intuitive use.
	•	Excellent: Views feel inevitable, creating a future where training is unnecessary.
	•	Transcendent: The view model becomes reusable across coordination systems.

⸻

Theme 6: Information Placement and Hierarchy

Purpose
To place information exactly where it is needed, when it is needed, without requiring search, memory, or interpretation.

Why This Matters
Misplaced information is functionally equivalent to missing information. Cognitive effort spent locating context undermines trust and increases errors.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Users hunt for details, creating a future of frustration.
	•	Expected: Information appears at the moment of need, creating a future of smooth action.
	•	Excellent: Hierarchy guides attention naturally, creating a future of confidence.
	•	Transcendent: The interface feels anticipatory rather than reactive.

⸻

Theme 7: Interaction Friction and Effort Budget

Purpose
To minimize taps, typing, and decisions so participation feels lightweight and sustainable.

Why This Matters
High effort discourages participation. Low effort increases follow-through. Interfaces must respect the user’s limited attention and energy.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Participation requires effort, creating a future of drop-off.
	•	Expected: Tasks are completable in seconds, creating a future of engagement.
	•	Excellent: Effort is consciously budgeted, creating a future of sustained use.
	•	Transcendent: The system feels easier than doing nothing.

⸻

Theme 8: Social Containment and Trust

Purpose
To prevent judgment, surveillance, and second-guessing by showing responsibility and system health rather than individual behavior.

Why This Matters
Visible underperformance creates shame and conflict. Coordination systems must reduce social risk, not amplify it.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The UI exposes individual gaps, creating a future of tension.
	•	Expected: Responsibility is visible without scrutiny, creating a future of trust.
	•	Excellent: Social pressure dissolves structurally, creating a future of ease.
	•	Transcendent: The system becomes safe for imperfect participation.

⸻

Theme 9: Mobile-First Reality

Purpose
To ensure the UI works flawlessly in the most constrained context: small screen, distracted user, one-handed interaction.

Why This Matters
Most real interaction happens on mobile. Desktop-first design creates friction where it matters most.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: Mobile feels secondary, creating a future of avoidance.
	•	Expected: Mobile flows are complete, creating a future of reliability.
	•	Excellent: Mobile becomes the reference case, creating a future of focus.
	•	Transcendent: The system fits seamlessly into daily life.

⸻

Theme 10: Disappearance of the Interface

Purpose
To design the UI so it fades into the background, allowing coordination to feel natural rather than technical.

Why This Matters
The best coordination systems are not noticed. When the interface disappears, the social process succeeds.

Outcomes
	•	Poor: The app demands attention, creating a future of resistance.
	•	Expected: The interface supports action quietly, creating a future of acceptance.
	•	Excellent: The UI becomes forgettable in the best sense.
	•	Transcendent: Coordination becomes a calm, repeatable ritual.

If you want, next we can:
	•	translate this directly into Figma AI constraints, or
	•	extract UI rejection rules (“this design is invalid if…”) to hard-bound the design space.

You now have a protocol that will not let the UI drift.
