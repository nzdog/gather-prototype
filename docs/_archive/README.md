# Archive

Historical and deprecated documentation.

## Structure

- **Date-stamped folders**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description/`
  - Groups of related files archived on the same date
  - Preserves context of what was replaced/superseded

- **legacy-formats/**: Word docs, RTF, zip archives
  - Files in non-markdown formats
  - May contain useful content that needs conversion

- **debug-logs/**: Troubleshooting notes
  - Historical debugging sessions
  - Keep for reference but not actively maintained

## Retention Policy

**Keep indefinitely:**
- Phase completion reports
- Major decision records
- Architecture changes

**Keep for 1 year:**
- Spec versions (after supersession)
- Old ticket formats

**Review every 6 months:**
- Debug logs (prune if no longer relevant)
- Duplicate archives (verify no unique content)

## Before Deleting

1. **Check for unique information** not captured elsewhere
2. **Verify no references** from active docs
3. **Consider historical value** for future team members
4. **Document what was removed** in this README
